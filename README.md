## Overview

Robotont dashboard and Blockly in one frontend: manual driving, LEDs, camera,
3D sensor viewing and block programming. The dashboard is at `/` and Blockly
is at `/blockly/`. Both pages use the separate
[robotont_web_bridge](https://github.com/t6niskoppel/robotont_web_bridge) ROS package
for real robots and Gazebo.

## Setup once

Requires Docker with Compose on Linux, or Node 22.12+ for local development.
From this repository:

```bash
docker compose build webapp
```

Build `robotont_web_bridge` in your ROS workspace separately; follow its README.
The frontend has `COLCON_IGNORE` and is not built by colcon.

## Run each time

Start the built frontend without rebuilding:

```bash
docker compose up -d webapp
```

In a separate ROS terminal, source the workspace, set the robot's actual domain
and namespace, and start the bridge. For example:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
export ROBOTONT_NAMESPACE=rt5
ros2 launch robotont_web_bridge web.launch.py namespace:=rt5 use_sim_time:=false
```

For Gazebo, use its ROS domain and namespace and pass `use_sim_time:=true`.
The frontend stays the same. Leave the bridge running while using the pages.

| Address | Page |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:5174/ | Dashboard |
| http://localhost:5174/blockly/ | Blockly |
| http://localhost:5174/viewer.html | Standalone sensor viewer |

The browser connects to rosbridge (9090), web_video_server (8080) and ttyd (7681)
on the same host as the frontend. Use a trusted private network: the bridge
exposes robot controls and a terminal without authentication by default.

Stop the frontend with `docker compose stop webapp` and the bridge with Ctrl+C.
Rebuild the frontend image after changing its source.

## Local development

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development server listens on port 5174. The ROS bridge must also be running
for robot discovery, sensors and commands.

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```
